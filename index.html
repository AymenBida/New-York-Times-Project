                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new
                        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing
                        far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have
                        been
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with.
                        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself
                        with a
                        special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                        speed
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to
                        pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
                        and
                        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
                        spit
                        in the ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning
                        of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational

                        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                        wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                        vast
                        realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.

                    <p>
                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                        space
                        with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos
                        whose
                        extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be
                        an
                        endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water
                        boiling
                        over.

                        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                        beyond
                        the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
                        Kovac’s
                        ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                        Einstein’s
                        theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                        team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                        gravitational waves.”

                    <p>
                        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                        as
                        the surface of the sun.

                        Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center

                        Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the
                        universe
                        expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                        Wherever we
                        look, the universe has an even temperature.

                        structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

                        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

                        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                        confirmation in his lifetime.

                        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
                        analysis.
                        Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a

                <p>
                    Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not
                    think
                    that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr.
                    Linde
                    wrote in an email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                    “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                    spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
                    will
                    go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                    project
                    called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                    beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a
                    pair
                    of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
                    model,
                    but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                    that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                    background
                    by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings
                    this
                    year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops
                    and
                    space.
                </p>
                <h2>Spirals in the Sky</h2>
                <p>
                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which
                    were
                    discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won
                    the
                    Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
                    leaders
                    of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South
                    Pole,
                    where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
                    University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
                    Stanford.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said.
                    He
                    has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
                    said.

                    In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
                    meaning
                    the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
                    Such
                    waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist
                    the
                    direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                    polarization
                    in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature
                    of
                    the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
                    Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
                    beat
                    them to the breakthrough.
                </p>
                <h2>A Special Time</h2>
                <p>
                    The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late
                    in
                    his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                    universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
                    strong
                    and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                    manifestations
                    of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
                    folk
                    mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
                    force after another splitting away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was where Dr. Guth came in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
                    degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case,
                    space
                    itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and
                    the
                    universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                    space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
                    from
                    a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
                    eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All
                    of
                    normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky
                    and
                    stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free
                    lunch,”
                    Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
                    vision
                    suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
                    comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other
                    bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going
                    any
                    deeper into the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
                    erases
                    everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept
                    away, forever out of our view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was
                    not
                    part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
